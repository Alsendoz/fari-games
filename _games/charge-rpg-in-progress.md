# Projects Extra | Extras

The Charge character sheet has a Projects section which contains 4 empty clocks.

Those exist if you want to track long term projects for your character.

Perhaps your character is piling up money to be able to afford something good for their family, or perhaps they are trying to figure out a way to reverse the damaged caused by a dangerous new disease.

One per session, if the narrative allows it, a character can try to make an Overcome an Obstacle roll to tick segments of those Clocks. Use them to track the long term projects of your character.

Upon completion, the PC get what they wanted and the resolution creates a new narrative thread that the group or the PC might pursue.

> ### Create an Asset
>
> Use this to try to change a situation for the better and set someone up for success.
>
> Assets let you improve an subsequent Action Roll by either: `+1d6`, `+Effect` or `+Position`
>
> 1. Pick an `Action` and find how many dice you need to roll
> 1. Determine the Position (`controlled`, `risky`, or `desperate`)
> 1. Determine the Effect Rating (`great`, `standard` or `limited`)
> 1. Choose one:
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `push yourself` (`-2 Momentum`)
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `use an Asset`
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `-1 Momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
