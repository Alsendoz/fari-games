# Introductions | Power Your Story Telling

![Charge](https://gyazo.com/cc0a8de71ba1591cf29885e4917d755f.png)

## Introductions

First, thank you.

The fact that you are reading this and are interested in playing this game means a lot to us, so thanks a million.

You're amazing, that's as simple as that.

Now, one of the first thing you probably want to know is: **who is this game for ?**

> This game is for people who want to play a generic and narrative table-top RPG adventure about a group of characters struggling to achieve their goals, but pushing themselves to try to get there.

Some mechanics were inspired or adapted from the Fate or Forged in the Dark systems, while others were created to make for more interactive sessions where the players are naturally urged to interact with the world.

Now let's get to it ⚡

## Work in Progress

This game is still a work in progress. Here are a couple of things that are still missing:

# Goals | Power Your Story Telling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/4e66d10b4b1784cc27093097134aaa35.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-sun-sea-dragon-flying-4033001/)

There are thousands of great table-top role-playing games out there. Some are generic, like Charge, and others are made with a very specific settings in mind. In the later, mechanics are often created to re-enforce the setting.

Charge is generic, which means that you get to pick the world and setting you want to play in. You could play in Sci-Fi setting where new planets are still being discovered and terraformed every year, or during the British Industrial Revolution. You get to choose.

Because each setting can be widely different, the game mechanics [in GAME_NAME] were made with very specific goals in mind to help you create the story you want to tell.

## Charge's

The two main pillars of this game center around Characters and Story Style.

**First, it should be easy to create a character for any setting.**

> Character should be able to be defined easily, yet still be able to be unique in their own way. They should also be able to be generic enough so that players can create the character they want to play in the setting they are most interested in.
>
> Charge does this by making character shine using `Aspects` to define who they are, `Actions` to highlight what they are good at, and `Talents` to make them evolve in interesting and way.

**The system should offer dials to have grimmer up to bigger than life adventures.**

> From a post apocalyptic survival adventure where each bullet counts to a grand space opera where the heroes always prevail, the mechanics should be able to be tuned easily to reflect the kind of story you want to tell.

You will probably like this game if:

- you like narrative focused systems
- you like that you can play in any settings
- you generally think that failure is more interesting than success
- you like when your character starts competent and gradually becomes more flexible
- you liked playing Fate or Forged in the Dark games

Charge also brings new interesting ideas to the table. Things like a new flexible progression framework and new mechanics to make players want to interact with the world instead of saying still on the back-seat to see when is the best moment to act.

We hope you have fun with this, because we sure had fun writing it and playing it.

Now, let us go over what you need to play Charge!

# What You Need To Play | Power Your Story Telling

To play Charge, you will need:

- Copies of the [Charge RPG Character Sheet](/charge-rpg/character-sheet.pdf)
- A pile of index cards
- A set of six sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- A bunch of awesome people to play with. Usually 2 to 5 people should do the trick. More than that prove to be quite an endeavour.

And that's it.

# The Game | Power Your Story Telling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cbb1bac26449de5d6762c699efe5585.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/spaceship-ufo-rock-mountains-5848274/)

Charge is a generic table-top role-playing game. That means that you and your friends will get together, and tell an interactive story about a group of fictional character you will create. Those characters will face obstacles and challenges, and you get to decide how they react. The world then changes based on what the characters do.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group will need to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it. At least those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table. We call those characters "non-playable characters", or *NPC*s.

The rest of the group will be `Players`. The players will create a character that will experience compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or *PC*s.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

This isn't a "GM versus Players" or "GM is god" kind of deal. If playing this game was like making a movie, the **GM would be the director** and all the **players would be writers**.

Everyone at the table is contributing to make the story successful and captivating.

## Game Structure

Everything inside Charge is collaborative.

You choose a setting together, you create your characters together, and you make that world evolve together.

Each session is made of `Scenes`, like in a movie. Each scene then plays out as a bunch of back and forth between the GM and the players. The GM will describe what the scene is like, the players will tell the GM what they do and the GM will make the world react to those actions depending on the outcome of certain dice rolls.

Each time you and your friends meet to play Charge is a `Session` which can last between 1 to 4 hours or even more. The amount of time each session is going to take depends on a lot of factors.

Each group can play very differently, as some might take their time while others might want to rush into things head on, but it also depends on people availability.

During sessions, tension will rise up during scenes and there will be narrative unknowns. To decide of what happens during those moment, we roll dice because we want to be on the edge of our seat. We want to be be surprised by where the story will take us next.

Next up, we will want to look at how we create the characters that will played by the players. But before that, we need to talk about making a safe environment for everyone at the table.

# Safety at the Table | Power Your Story Telling

## Safety Tools

If at any point during the game creation process or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

## RPG Etiquette

Remember to be empathetic of people's schedule and responsibilities. Some people have kids, pets, jobs, and other things that make scheduling sessions very hard. Show up on time and take the amount of gameplay time what you can get.

Then, patiently wait until the next session. And while you are waiting, remember and praise the awesome moments that happened in the last session.

# Creating your Character | Character Creation

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/6c402c4fb66bc6ac29d20b7bee048d9a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/landscape-fantastic-surreal-mood-6543972/)

As a player, you will need to create a `Character`.

Your character will be defined by certain traits that we call `Aspects`. They will affect the world around them with their `Actions`. Through their actions might come `Consequences` which might inflict `Stress` or worsen their `Condition`.

Aspects are a good way to make your characters unique, but Charge uses `Talents` to make each character shine in their own special way.

You can find each of those terms in the character sheet, but let's go over what all of them mean and how we use them during a session.

## Aspects

**Aspects** are short phrases used to describe something important about a character.

The first thing to know about them is that **Aspects are true**. If your character has an aspect that says **_Fire Magician_**, they are a magician that can control fire. As simple as that.

Characters usually have between 3-6 aspects, and each one of them represents a different trait about that character.

![](https://gyazo.com/3f0e20b165cb023e77b84c12c9c09e71.png)

### High Concept

The `High Concept` is a board description of a character. It's how you would quickly describe them when talking about them with a friend.

Kind of like an elevator pitch version of who they are in a nutshell.

A high concept could highlight your character's profession, tie to an organization or a powerful talent.

### Trouble

Next is a character’s `Trouble`.

The trouble aspect is something that makes a character’s life more complicated.

It could be a personal weakness, family entanglements, or other obligations. Try to pick something that will be fun to role-play!

The trouble is also very useful for the GM has they can use it as inspiration when thinking about `Adding Tension` to a scene.

### Relationship

A `Relationship` aspect describes a connection with another PC in the group.

To come up with this, try to think of an event in the character's life and see how another character might have been involved.

Did the two of them accomplished a great victory together, or perhaps one owes a debt to another.

It's easy to fall into classic tropes like "My character doesn't like/trust this other character", but we would encourage to try to find something a bit different. This is mostly because this kind of relationship aspect often adds unnecessary complications in the homogeneity of the group as a whole.

### Other Aspects

You can make your character’s last aspects anything you want. There are no restrictions beyond the obligation to fit the setting.

Choose anything which you think will make your character more interesting, more fun to play, or better connected to the world they live in.

> #### Choosing Aspects in Play
>
> You don't need to entirely flesh out your character before you start playing.
>
> Simply choosing a `High Concept` and a `Trouble` aspect is more than enough to get going.
>
> After the first session or two, you will get a better idea of who your character is, so finding aspects later is totally fine.
>
> But if you want some help in finding interesting aspects for your characters, you can always use the free [Fari Story Builder](https://fari.app/story-builder) to get the inspiration flowing again!
> ![](https://gyazo.com/5b5e8bf5924e020ea2bc0926103a20f2.gif)

## Actions

If a player character wants to do something that's challenging or could potentially fail, we make an **action roll.**

Failure is possible if there is some sort of obstacle to overcome, like something that's in your way or somebody looking to stop you.

That being said, not every interaction with the world requires a roll. If the action the character is doing is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then you don't roll anything. They simply do it.

In Charge, there are **12 actions** that characters can do.

When creating a character, you need to **distribute 7 action dots** among those 12 actions. At the start of a campaign, a single Action cannot have more than 2 action dot.

Those dots represent how good your character is at doing things. As the game progresses, you will gain additional dots that you will use to make your character more flexible. See [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](mechanics#progression).

The 12 actions are regrouped in 3 categories called `Attributes`.

There is `Physique`, `Insight` and `Resolve`. Each attribute is important in its own way, since they let you resist different types of danger when things go sour. More on that in [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Resistance Roll**](mechanics#resistance-roll).

For now let's look at the 12 different types of actions.

### The 12 Actions

![12 Actions](https://gyazo.com/a0cc5668a0e3b486af1b166099b9da51.png)

#### Physique

When you `Brawl`, you clash with something that is in your way.

> You might hack and slash. You might wrestle with a wild animal. You might blast a door open. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but Finessing might be better).

When you `Finesse`, you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.

> You might steal something from someone’s pocket. You might hack a security system. You might helm the controls of a ship. You could try to pick a lock (but Tinkering might be better).

When you `Move`, you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.

> You might climb, swim, run or jump. You might outpace the guards. You might jump above a spiked pit. You could try to loose someone on your tail (but Sneak might be better).

When you `Sneak`, you traverse skilfully and quietly.

> You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You could try to back-stab a solder in the middle of a battle (but Brawl might be better).

#### Insight

When you `Shoot`, you carefully track and shoot a target.

> You might snipe an enemy from a long distance. You might throw a fireball to put the battlefield on fire. You might aim the ship's laser guns. You could try skillfully throw a dart in a bar game (but Finessing might be better).

When you `Tinker`, you understand, create, repair complex mechanisms or organisms.

> You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might mend a broken bone. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but Finessing might be better).

When you `Study`, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

> You might gather information from documents, newspapers, and books. You might closely analyze a person to detect lies or true feelings. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation (but Noticing might be better).

When you `Notice`, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

> You might pick up important details in the moment. You might anticipate danger before it happens. You could try to figure out what is making someone sick (but Studying might be better).

#### Resolve

When you `Bond`, you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.

> You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm, style or empathy. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but Sway might be better).

When you `Command`, you compel swift obedience with skills and respect.

> You might intimidate or threaten to get what you want. You might ask a small militia to get their things together. You might order your undead minions to sacrifice themselves for you. You could also ask your familiar to look for something in a room (but Bonding might be better).

When you `Focus`, you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.

> You might meditate to enter the spirit world. You might concentrate to win a game of chess. You might enter a trance to finish up an important ritual. You could try to pay a closer attention to your surrounding beyond what is visible (but Noticing might be better).

When you `Sway`, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

> You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but Consorting or Commanding might be better).

### **Which Action to Pick for a Roll**

Some actions may overlap with others. This is by design. As your campaign progress, you group will also start establishing which action gives the most effect in certain situations.

Make this game your own.

As a player, you get to choose which action you roll by simply saying what your character does. Though choosing an approach versus another might influence the position or effect of your action. The GM should tell you those details before you roll.

## Momentum

A character's `Momentum` is a track that represents the _momentum_ of your character. The more you interact with the world, and the people that live in it, the more your character gains `charges of momentum`.

You then consume those charges to boost your action rolls or assist your teammates.

![](https://gyazo.com/e0aac9468c6a2a2932e59da933c64e21.png)

When you are out of momentum, things can go bad pretty quickly since you also use them to resist incoming consequences or harm.

## Stress & Conditions

When your character faces dangerous challenges and fails their action roll, something bad happens.

Maybe the situation is more complicated or even perilous. The alternative to this is that you get hurt. The GM is the one who decides if the `Consequence` of the roll is harm or something else.

Each character has 3 Conditions, one for each action attribute. So there is a `Physical`, `Insight` and a `Resolve` condition. Each of them has 4 stress boxes.

![](https://gyazo.com/5f24d520f08dd0f9bff0748bb251c098.png)

When you get hurt, you take a certain amount of `Stress` on an attribute and you get a new `Condition Aspect` that represents the state of your character.

Your conditions are aspects, and since **all aspects are true**, it means that if a character get a new condition aspect, the character narrative liberties are restricted by said aspect.

For example, it's almost impossible to climb on the roof of a house with a _Twisted Anlke_. So even if only have `2 stress` on your physical condition, the name of the aspect still imposes narrative restrictions on what your character can do.

Since condition aspects represent your character's current state, you need to update that aspect to match the state of your character's condition as they get more stress.

- When an attribute's condition reaches **1/2 stress**, you might be: exhausted, humiliated, tired, sore, winder, sick, etc.
- When an attribute's condition reaches **3 stress**, you might be: shot, slashed, have a first degree burn, or are completely drunk.
- When an attribute's condition reaches **4 stress**, you might have: a second degree burn, a fractured leg or your brain can't comprehend was is happening anymore.

Upon reaching 4 stress, you clear your stress track, and your character is taken out for the scene for they need immediate attention.

## Talents

`Talents` are a way to make the characters progress over the course of a campaign.

Overtime, characters will gain new `Talent Dots` which will make their Talent Line advance.

![](https://gyazo.com/6cab207e891b02249a7f96c66694010a.png)

Every dot in the talent line gives you either a new Action Dot, or a `Situational Bonus`.

Situational bonuses are either a boost in `effect`, `position` or `dice pool` that are only triggered when a certain situation happens.

You don't need to worry about talents right now, especially if you just started your campaign.

When your campaign reaches a significant turning point, you can go and read [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](progression#major-milestones) to know where to go from now to make the characters feel more powerful.

## Projects and Complications

The `Projects and Complication` sections of the character sheet is something both the GM and players can use to track long term projects or ever evolving danger that spans across multiple sessions.

![](https://gyazo.com/cc0d601c9fc82fbfe8a433ac3fdc303d.png)

You don't need to know how to use this right away, so for more on this, checkout [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Projects and Complications**](mechanics#projects-and-complications).

## Character Recap

That covers the basic of how to create a character for Charge.

Now we will go over all the mechanics used in the game that exist to resolve unknown elements in the narrative.

> #### The Character Sheet
>
> - 3-6 Aspects to highlight who you are. (High Concept, Trouble, Relationship and other aspects)
> - 7 Action dots distributed across the 12 actions to explain what you are good at.
> - Momentum charges to boost your actions and help your teammates.
> - 3 Condition aspects with 4 stress slot each to track a character's physical, insight or resolve condition.
> - Talent Line to make the characters feel more powerful.
> - Projects and Complications clocks to track session spanning efforts or dangers.

# Fiction First | Mechanics

[![Image by Yuri_B from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/d6e7b317330d9dd554970cc75543ea7e.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/painting-knight-night-oil-paints-3995999/)

**Charge is a "fiction first" game.**

This means that the GM and the players will tell a story, and afterwards, will look at the rules to see if something needs to be resolved using the game's mechanics.

You can see the mechanics as a toolbox that you can use when they are needed. They exist to resolve situation where you basically don't know the direct answers to a question.

**_Will this character find what they are looking for, can that character convince this merchant to talk, how will this faction react to this big event, etc._**

Sometimes, those situation are resolved with a mechanic that relies on the PC's proficiencies, while other times they might be resolved with mechanics that strait up relies on luck!

The reason we do this is to create a "wow feeling" in unknown situations. While the story is created by everyone at the table, the mechanics will act as a guide that will drive the narrative forward with unexpected outcomes.

Those mechanics mostly rely on figuring out what is happening and what are the risks. Than a set of six sided dice are rolled, results are interpreted and the story continue.

# Rolling Dice | Mechanics

Charge uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it’s a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it’s a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that’s a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it’s a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal, and you suffer complications, too.

The number of dice a player rolls depends on the `Action` they are trying to accomplish. In Charge, there are 12 possible actions grouped in 3 distinct attributes.

Those actions are linked to a dice pool called the `Action Rating`, represented by empty dots on the character sheet.

If an action has 1 darkened dots beside it, it means that you get to roll `1d6` and pick the best one out of the two. This gives you about 50% chance of succeeding in your action.

If an action has 2 darkened dots, then you roll `2d6` and so on.

### Active Opposition

Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**.

The action roll tells us what is the result and the consequences of an action at the same time.

On a `6`, the PC wins and gets what they wanted to do. On a `4/5`, both the PC and the NPC have an effect on the result. On a `1-3`, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.

### No Action Dots

If an action doesn't have any action dots darkened beside it, then you roll `2d6` and **pick the worst**. This gives you around 25% chance of success, so the odds aren't great.

That being said, you can always `Push Yourself`, `Add Tension` to the action, get an `Assist` or use an `Asset` to add more dice to your pool. More on that later.

For now, let's take a look at the different tools that you can use to resolve the different situations that arise in your story.

# Action Roll | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/a2bbeb6748035e90162096c3e0a9680a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-landscape-architecture-3898554/)

**_I have a bad feeling about this..._**

You want to try to accomplish a goal, but something or someone is in your way.

A person might be keeping information private that you desperately need, a locked door might block you from moving forward to save your friend, or a group of thug intercept you in an alley and want revenge for something you've done to them in the past.

That's a challenge that needs to be overcome.

The first step in knowing if you succeed or not at overcoming that challenge is to know what your character is doing.

### Action

When you make an action roll, you need to know which of the **12 Actions** your character is going for. Are they `Bonding` with a local merchant, or `Swaying` them into thinking that their prices are too high ?

Use the action rating (darkened dots beside the action) as your base dice pool.

> #### Choosing an Action
>
> The action you are going to choose will have an impact on the `Effect` and the `Position` of the roll.
>
> We are going to talk about those in a second, but just know that if you choose a certain action and aren't satisfied when the GM tells you what are the effect or situation is, you can go back and pick another action.

### Position

If an obstacle is in your way, you are in either in a `controlled`, `risky` or `desperate` position. The GM is responsible for telling you this information.

In most common scenarios, if you are rolling to overcome something, you are probably in a `risky` position.

Multiple things can affect your current position. You may be vastly outnumbered, or perhaps you are just out of time. The narrative context will help you and the GM decide what's your current position.

If the merchant you are trying to convince is in a bad mood, using `Sway` might be a pretty `desperate` move. Perhaps `Bond` could put you in a more `controlled` situation.

> #### What Position to Pick
>
> If you aren't sure what's your current situation, talk with the rest of the table. A quick discussion is usually enough to clear things up.

Your position is there to help you determine what failure might look like. Once you know your position, the GM will then tell you what the effect might look like if you succeed your roll.

### Effect

Your position isn't the only thing helping you dictate the end result of a roll. Even in a desperate position, succeeding on a roll might still have a great effect on the narrative.

In Charge, there are 3 possible effect rating: `great`, `standard` or `limited`. In most common scenarios, if you are rolling to overcome something, you are probably looking at generating a `standard` effect. The GM is responsible for telling you this information.

If a heavy door is blocking your way, you could use `Finesse` to pick the lock. This might be generating a `standard effect`, since it will take some time to do, but it's a more `controlled position`. You could also try to use `Tinker` and wreck the door open with an explosive. This will be of `great effect`, but might be a `desperate move`, since it might create a lot of unwanted attention.

The Effect Rating is there to help you determine what success might look like.

#### The Fourth Effect Rating

We said there was only 3 effect rating, and that was actually a little bit of a lie. There's a fourth one called: `no-effect`.

The GM can use this when a task is difficult that what ever the PC attempts, the best they will end up getting is "nothing".

Obviously, doing nothing is boring. That's why you can boost that `no-effect` to a `limited effect` if you Push Yourself using charges of momentum. More on that in [Even the Odds](#even-the-odds)

#### The Impact of Effect & Position

The effect and position help us understand what happen in narrative, but they also have a mechanical impact on the game.

To know what impact it has, there's a numerical rating attached to each of them.

| Position     | Effect     | Rating |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| `Desperate`  | `Great`    | 3      |
| `Risky`      | `Standard` | 2      |
| `Controlled` | `Limited`  | 1      |

When a roll has consequences, you use the position rating to see how many segments you tick on danger clocks, or how much stress a character gets when getting harmed, etc.

When a roll is a success, you use the effect rating to see how many segments you tick on progress clocks, how much information the character gets out of an investigation, etc.

More on clocks in [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Clocks**](mechanics#clocks)

### Even the Odds

Your characters aren't proficient in everything, but they have more aces up their sleeves to even the odds stacked against them.

First off, they aren't alone.

When you `Ask for Help`, a willing player can consume `-1 momentum` of momentum, in exchange for you to get `+1d6` added to your dice pool. In doing so, the helper exposes themselves to the same danger as your character for helping you.

You can also even the odds by using **only one** of the following methods.

#### Push Yourself

When you `Push Yourself`, you consume `-2 momentum` of momentum **per push** to gain one of the following bonus.

- Gain `+1d6` added to your dice pool.
- Gain `+ 1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action when you are incapacitated.

#### Add Tension

When you `Add Tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension would look like here?"_. The GM can then offer a complication like ticking segments in danger clocks, inflicting stress on your character or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the deal, you get `+1d6` added to your dice pool.

#### Use an Asset

Assets are an optional rule available in [Extras&nbsp;»&nbsp;Asset Extra](asset-extra), but they are still considered an option for you to event the odds if you are using that Extra.

### Recap

So now, let's go over all of this again to recap what happens when you make an action roll.

> #### Action Roll
>
> 1. Pick an Action and find how many dice you need to roll (the `action rating`)
> 1. Determine the Position (`controlled(1)`, `risky(2)`, or `desperate(3)`)
> 1. Determine the Effect Rating (`great(3)`, `standard(2)` or `limited(1)`)
> 1. Add `+1d6` if: you `push yourself` (-2 momentums) -or- if you `add tension` to the action.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `Assistance` (they consume -1 momentum)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
> ---
>
> - On a `66 critical success`, you greatly overcome the obstacle
> - On a `6 full success`, you overcome the obstacle.
> - On a `4/5 partial success`, you overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.

_Yann's character wants to take out a guard without him noticing anything. He decides to use **Sneak**. The GM looks at the situation and assesses that it's a **Risky Position** since the guard might not be alone, but the outcome would be of **Great Effect** because the guard isn't on high alert. Yann doesn't want to leave everything up to chance, and decides to even the odds. He declares that his character will **Push Themselves** to get an additional `+1d6` by diving in the water to get into a better position before taking the guard out. Yann rolls his dice pool and... gets a `5`, partial success! The GM than says that he takes our the guard, but ticks 2 segments off an "Alert Clock" because of the noise Yann's character made pulling the guard in the water., \*_

# Consequences| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b40cf4934bebc8628bd3696c4e3b92c.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-castle-light-heaven-4382262/)

**_Sometimes things work out, other times..._**

If you make an action roll and you get a `partial success (4/5)` or a `bad outcome (1-3)`, you suffer a `Consequence`.

Consequences are a tool that the GM can use to spice up the story. The GM determines the type of consequence, using the fiction, the style and tone established by the group.

> #### I Have an Idea!
>
> If anyone at the table has idea for a good consequence, hear them out! It can be daunting as a GM to always know what happens in case of failure. That is true especially if luck isn't on the player's side, and you need to find lots of different consequences in the same session.
>
> As the GM, don't hesitate to ask your players for ideas as well. Someone might have a fascinating suggestion, but they think it's not their place to speak up. Prove them otherwise.

Here are a couple of types of consequences that can be inflicted in case of a bad roll:

### Reduced Effect

**_You hit them, but it's only a flesh wound. The security cameras are turned off, but the technicians are aware, and are looking to fix them as soon as possible._**

This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated.

This consequence essentially reduces the **effect level** of the PC’s action **by one** after all other factors are accounted for.

### Complications

**_They heard you, and they are coming. You took too long, and you are almost out of air._**

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat.

In most common scenarios, the GM will create a new **Danger Clock** ([**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Clocks**](mechanics#clocks)) or tick a segment off an existing one to represent this new danger.

The number of segments ticked on the clock depends on the position rating of the roll.

**Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll**. If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a `4/5`, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.

### Lost Opportunity

**_You were tailing on someone, but they saw you and disappeared. You were fighting robots, but they learn and adapted, they are now able to anticipate your every move._**

This consequence represents shifting circumstance. What you tried didn't work, and now there's a new situation that prevents you from trying again. You need to find another approach.

Usually this means trying using another `Action`.

You need to `Bond` with your contacts to know if they heard of the person that evaded you, or you need to `Survey` the robot to see if they have any weak spots you can use to your advantage.

### Worse Position

**_You missed your shot, now they know where you are. They initially trusted you, but know they have some doubts and will be watching you more closely._**

This consequence represents losing control of the situation. The action carries you into a more dangerous **position**.

Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position.

This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from **controlled**, to **risky**, to **desperate** as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper into trouble.

### Worse Condition

This consequence represent injuries or trauma inflected on a character.

When your condition worsen, you take a certain amount of `stress` on an `attribute` and the `condition aspect` of that attribute to represent the new state of your character is in. 

Since **aspects are true**, your new condition aspect is going to affect the permissions of how you can interact with the world narratively.

Upon reaching 4 stress, you clear your stress track, and your character is taken out for the scene for they need immediate attention.

### Recap

> #### Consequences
>
> - **Reduced Effect** : `-1 effect` rating.
> - **Complication**: create or tick a `clock`.
> - **Worse Position** : `-1 position` rating.
> - **Lost Opportunity** : try something else.
> - **Harm**: Take `stress`.

# Resistance Roll| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3c9ae5d526da51b44be1e7953077be51.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-battle-warrior-fire-falcon-3721894/)

**_Not on my watch!_**

If a character suffers a consequence that you, as a player, don't like, you can choose to resist it.

Simply tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” The GM then tells you if resisting that consequence is going to negate it completely or simply reduce it.

> #### Avoiding vs Reducing Consequences
>
> By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of the game. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.

You’ll then make a `Resistance Roll` to see how much momentum your character consume as a result of their resistance.

You make the roll using one of your character’s `Attributes Pool` (`Physique`, `Insight`, or `Resolve`).

That dice pool consists of `+1d6` for each dot in the first column on that attribute.

The GM chooses the attribute you use, based on the nature of the consequence:

- `Physique`: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
- `Insight`: Consequences from deception or understanding.
- `Resolve`: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.

When you resist consequences, you do it using charges of Momentum. Getting a good roll consumes less charge, while bad rolls makes you consume more of it.

> | Result | Name               | Explanation                 |
> | ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You gain `+1 momentum`.     |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You consume `-1 momentum`.  |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You consume `-2 momentums`. |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You consume `-3 momentums`. |
>
> If you can't consume all the required charges of momentum, the GM inflicts 2 Consequences instead of one which cannot be resisted.

If you want, you can also resist a consequence that isn't targeting you directly . If you want to do so, see [**Team Work&nbsp;»&nbsp;Protect**](team-work#protect).

```
TODO: INCLUDE EXAMPLE
```

### Recap

> #### Resistance Rolls
>
> - Roll your Attribute Pool (Prowess, Insight, Resolve).
>   - On a `66`, gain `+1 momentum`
>   - On a `6`, consume `-1 momentum`
>   - On a `4/5`, gain `-2 momentums`
>   - On a `1-3`, gain `-3 momentums`
> - GM declares 2 consequences if you can't consume all the required charges. Those consequences cannot be resisted.

# Flashbacks | Mechanics

The rules don’t distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a flashback to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you went to a bar last night and befriended a couple of guards to make them drunk so that they call sick the next dat, so you make a `Bond` roll to see how that went.

The GM sets a cost in `charges of momentum` for you to activate the flashback.

- `0 Momentum`: An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity.
- `1 Momentum`: A complex action or unlikely opportunity.
- `2 (or more) Momentum`: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies.

After the momentum is consumed, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there’s some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won’t call for a roll at all because you can just consume the momentum and it’s accomplished.

After the GM describes the trouble you’re in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, “just in case” something like this happened. This way, your “flashback planning” will be focused on the problems that \_do \_happen, not the problems that might happen.

## Limits of flashbacks

A flashback isn’t time travel. It can’t “undo” something that just occurred in the present moment. If the GM described something in the scene, it is now established in the fiction.

While you can't undo what has already happened, you can twist and adapt things that were left unsaid.

For instance, if a Maître D' is making a scene to stop you from entering at a very high end restaurant, that's perhaps you `Swayed` them into doing this the night before in exchange for money to make a diversion for the rest of the group.

# Momentum | Mechanics

We've talked about the fact that characters have a `Momentum` track, which starts with `2` charges at the beginning of every session.

We've also seen that momentum can be consumed to **boost action rolls**, **assist allies**, **lead group actions** and do **flashback scenes**.

Now we will go over the different methods to gain momentum during scenes.

Basically, you can either gain momentum as a **result of an action roll**, or because of a **compel**.

## Momentum from an Action

Everytime you make an action roll, you have a chance of gaining new charges of momentum.

The reason why you start with only `2` at the beginning of a session is because we want players who are running low to engage with the game mechanics instead of sitting back because they are out of resources.

**The main way you are going to get momentum back is by participating in the game.**

**By default**, you gain momentum when you make an action roll, and you rolled a `4` or above.

- If you rolled a `4/5`, you gain `+1 Momentum`.
- If you rolled a `6`, you gain `+2 Momentum`.
- If you rolled a `66`, you gain `+3 Momentum`.

While this is the default setting, we encourage you and your group to play and change this as you wish. We want you to consider hacking this rule because it is the basis of the whole meta-economy of the game. Making momentum harder or easier to gain will have a big impact on the way the game is going to play out.

### Momentum Dial

Changing **when and how much momentum is gained** is called a `Momentum Dial`. Your group can decide to use with the default dial provided by the game, since it is a good starting point. It is the default dial for a reason.

But if for example you want to emphasis the fact that life is hard and resources are scarce, then consider making momentum harder to gain. If on the other hand, you want to tell the story of characters who are all over the top, but still find a way to finish every adventure with their hat still sitting on their head, then consider making momentum easier to gain.

## Momentum from Adding Tension

The second way you can gain momentum is by `Adding Tension` to the scene.

As a player, you can suggest a complication to your GM, and if they agree with it you gain `+2 Momentum`.

When you add tension to a scene, you usually self-inflict a `Consequence` on yourself or the group to add interesting drama to the scene.

# Recovery | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/152570ee1895591ed40e267ac4eb35c1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-planet-futuristic-earth-5312500/)

**_Now, breathe..._**

As the game plays out, the PCs will get more stressed out and their condition will worsen.

When a PC accumulates `Stress`, making action rolls will be more limited because of the narrative restrictions `condition aspects` create.

Stress and condition aspects exists to pace the game. Not every action is going to go well, and failing an action has consequences which will affect the characters for some time.

Things will eventually go back to normal, and the PCs will recover. But for the recovery to happen, it needs to happen in the **fiction first**.

## Recovering in the Fiction

When a player wants their character to recover stress, there needs to be **Downtime** in the fiction.

If the group spends 3 sessions battling monsters in an epic dungeon, and tension is always up the roof, than the fiction doesn't allow for the process recovery to beging.

That being said, **Downtime** doesn't mean that all the PCs have to sit down by a campfire and talk until they are all at "full health".

The structure of a game of Charge isn't enforced, so the PCs can do what ever they want, whenever they want.

So **once per session**, if the fiction allows it, reduce all the stress track of your character by one level.

We aren't using dice to support this mechanic because we don't believe luck should _generally_ factor in the healing process. Of course, there are moments where it could. If you want, you can use the [Fortune Rolls](fortune-roll) mechanic to resolve this type of situation.

## Recap

> #### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, reduce stress by one level on all stress tracks.

# Fortune Roll| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/66adea5dff68c16c02527472648c8110.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-sunset-planet-mars-heaven-5312660/)

**_The future is in constant flux._**

Not everything is about the proficiencies of the PCs. There are situations where something is simply up to chance. In those situations, the GM can call for a `Fortune Roll`.

_You are looking in the wreckage of a ship, is there anybody left alive ? You find a pistol on the ground, is there still bullets in it ? Two factions are at war, who's going to win the final battle ?_

To make a fortune roll, you need to assess the chances of a thing of actually happening.

Is that thing likely or unlikely to happen ? For each "likeliness" level, add `1d6` to the dice pool.

- If there's 50% of success, roll `1d6`. If it's more than that, add more dice to the pool.
- If it's really unlikely, roll `2d6` and pick the worst.

If two forces are opposing one another, roll two opposing pools and take the best result of each to interpret who "won" and by how much.

Once the pool(s) are ready, throw the dice and interpret the results.

_There's someone left alive on the ship and they are still breathing. There are bullets in the gun, but the gun itself is broken and can't be use._

Don't overthink this. This rule is vague by design, as it should not get in the way of the game. This mechanic is there to **quickly spice things up** during a scene.

```
TODO: INCLUDE EXAMPLE
```

### Recap

> #### Fortune Roll
>
> - Add `1d6` per likeliness level.
> - Roll `2d6` and pick the worst if it's really unlikely.
>

>
> - On a **critical success**, great results, and something exceptional happen.
> - On a **full success**, great results.
> - On a **partial success**, mixed results.
> - On a **bad outcome**, bad results.

# Team Work| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cdd5a6bc018b408a461740f0f4451a1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-moon-people-night-dream-6203763/)

**_It's dangerous to go alone, take this!_**

There are multiple ways player characters can help each other in Charge. They could **Assist** each other, **Take the Lead** on an action or perhaps they want to **Protect** another PC from danger.

### Assist

**_I can't reach it, can you give me a boost ?_**

When you `Assist`, you help another player who's making an action roll. Describe what your character does to help. **Consume `1 charge`** and give them an additional `+1d6` for their roll.

Be warned that, by doing this, you are also exposing yourself to possible consequences that this roll might end up creating.

### **Take the Lead**

**_It's fine, I know the way. Just follow me, but don't make a sound, or you'll wake it up._**

When you take the lead, you coordinate multiple members of the group to tackle a problem together. Describe how your character is leading the group.

Each player character who's involved makes a **action roll**. The team counts the **single best result** as the final result.

However, the character leading the group action consume `-1 charge` for each PC that rolled **1-3** as their best result. It’s tough covering for the everyone!

**The group action result covers everyone who rolled.** If you don’t roll, your character doesn’t get the effects of the action.

### Protect

**_Get behind my shield!_**

You step-in to confront a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. **You suffer it instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.** Simply describe how you intervene.

# Clocks| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/8aeb209f8442ddf2ed9dab425bd9b603.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/cave-fantastic-light-nature-6481713/)

A `Clock` is a circle **divided into 4, 6 or 8 segments**. Draw a clock when you need to track an ongoing effort against an obstacle that cannot be resolved with a simple action roll.

Sneaking into a restricted area? Make a Clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments the clock should have.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

Segments of clocks are ticked after an action roll. The **effect and position rating** help use decide how many segments should ge ticked as a result of the roll.

Clocks should always be about the obstacle that needs to be overcome, and not be about the "how". The action of the character already takes care of explaining the "how".

Here are a couple of examples of how clocks could be used to represent some situation that might arise during scenes.

> ### Progress Clocks
>
> Represent the ongoing effort of someone to achieve their goal. You tick this clock by using the `effect rating` of an action roll on successes.
>
> _How much money to we need before we can fix the ship? How much damage can the city withstand before there's nothing left to save ?_
>
> ### Danger Clocks
>
> Represent the imminent danger about to face the player. You tick this clock by using the `position rating` of an action roll on consequences.
>
> _How long until they realize we are here ? How much oxygen do we have left ?_
>
> ### Opposing Clocks
>
> Represents the progress of two opposing parties to get to their goal. The effect and position ratings can both be used to tick one or the other clock.
>
> _Can we win the race against the fan favourite ? Can we convince the judge that we are wrongly accused before the end of the trial?_

### Recap

> #### Clocks
>
> Used to define complex obstacles.
>
> - GM creates a clock to representing long-lasting obstacles.
>   - Divide in 4 segments for a complex obstacle.
>   - Divide in 6 segments for a complicated obstacle.
>   - Divide in 8 segments for a daunting obstacle.
>
> ---
>
> When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can tick segments of a `Progress Clock`:

# Progression | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/635caaef063a8652b3ce86a0ad3eeb7a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-clock-time-light-magic-3517206/)

**_That's something I'm never going to forget._**

In Charge, the characters are talented and proactive. After all, they are the protagonists of the story. If they fail at a task, it's _probably_ more because of unplanned circumstances than because of their lack of skills.

As time advance, the characters will evolve, and become more versatile, but this will only happen at certain `Milestones`.

### Minor Milestones

A `Major Milestone` happens **at the end of each session**. When a session is over, each player can look at their character sheet and **rename an aspect that isn't their `High Concept`.**

You can use this to make your character life's change depending on what happened in the last session.

You aren't forced to do this, but the game gives you the time and opportunity do it.

```
TODO: INCLUDE EXAMPLE
```

### Major Milestones

A `Major Milestone` usually happens **at the end of a big event** in the story. This will _usually_ happen every 3-5 sessions.

The GM will probably feel when it's time for a Major Milestone, but as a player you can always remind the GM "_Hey, this looked like an important event in the story, would this be a major milestone ?_".

Just go with what feels right and adapt if necessary.

When the group reaches a major milestone, every character gets a new `Talent` on their character sheet.

There are 4 types of talents a character can get when reaching this milestone:

- `+1 Action Dot`: You can increase any action on your character sheet by 1 dot.
- `+1 Effect when \_\_\_\_`: In a certain situation, the effect rating described by the GM is increased by 1.
- `+1 Position when \_\_\_\_`: In a certain situation, the position rating described by the GM is increase by 1.
- `+1d6 when \_\_\_\_` : In a certain situation, you can add `+1d6` to your dice pool.

Gaining a new talent will feels like a breath of fresh air. It won't make your characters overpowered or god like, but it will make them more flexible, or more specialized.

> #### Progression Curve
>
> Just as a reminder, the longer it takes for a major milestone to happen, the longer it will take for characters to become stronger.
>
> This is important to keep in mind depending on what kind of progression curve you want to have. Do you want to have a short campaign where characters will grow stronger pretty quickly, or are you looking for a year spanning campaign where the characters will mostly evolve by changing their aspects and major milestones will be more scarce ?
>
> You could go as low as giving the player character only 2-3 Talents during an entire campaign, or reward them more often.
>
> There isn't a right or wrong answer here. It depends a 100% on what kind of campaign you want to have. This is also something you can discuss with the group to make sure everyone has the same expectations.

### Situational Talents

Certain talents are situational. That is, they are only activated when you are in a **certain context** and using a **specific action**.

For example, when you get a **+1 Effect when \_\_\_\_**, you will need to finish the end of that sentence by choosing one of the **12 Action** and a certain **Situation** that will activate the talent.

Just look at what as already been established in the world or your character aspects for inspiration.

To keep the flow of the game balanced, the GM will have a veto on what situation is good enough for your talent. Don't hesitate to experiment with a this and fine tune later if necessary.

The fact that writing up situational talents takes a bit of work is the reason why you don't get any talent when you create a fresh character.

We want character creation to be streamlined, so take the time to understand and discover who they are first. Later in the campaign, when a major milestone occurs, you can then think of new ways to make them truly unique using talents.

_Yann's character is a monster hunter. By consequence, he's pretty good at **Studying** and **Brawling** in general. Yann also just got a new **Talent Dot** and would like to excel at tracking monsters specifically. Because monsters aren't encountered that frequently in the game, he asks the GM if his talent could be "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters**". The GM agrees. Now, Yann's character should be feared by most creatures roaming the lands._

_In another session, the GM realizes that Yann's talent is perhaps too generic, and could be tuned a little. He then asks if it could be rewritten as something like "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters in the forest**" or something along those lines. Yann agree saying "My character lived in the forest all their life, and would probably be intimated by big cities. I like it, let's go with this for now!"_

# Projects and Complications | Mechanics

The Charge character sheet has a `Projects & Complications` section which contains a set of empty `Clocks`.

Those clocks represent long term projects or ever evolving danger that the character will work on or experience across multiple sessions.

## Long Term Projects

**_Perhaps your character is piling up money to be able to afford something good for their family, or perhaps they are trying to figure out a way to reverse the damaged caused by a dangerous new disease that's plaguing the city._**

In any case, once per session, if the narrative allows it, a character can make an action roll to work on those long term projects. Those projects will be tracked using `progress clocks` on the character sheet. The `effect` rating of the roll determines how much the project progresses per session.

Upon the completion of a project, the PC gets what they were working for. The resolution of said project creates a new narrative thread explained by the GM. This thread is something the group can decide to pursue or not.

## Complication

**_Perhaps the police department is starting to realize there are missing pieces in the evidence locker, or perhaps you are starting to attract more and more heat on you and your crew after your last couple jobs._**

When a `complication` occurs as a result of a `consequence` of an action roll, the GM can tell the player to start or tick a `Danger Clock` on their character sheet.

Those complications aren't bound to the scene. Instead, they are tied to the character or the group as a whole.

Upon the completion of a complication's danger clock, the GM reveals a new dangerous situation to the group to represent what comes as a result of their actions.

Depending on the context, this new complication could be **imposed or exposed** to the group. **When imposed**, the characters need to resolve it as soon as possible. The story cannot continue without this being taken care of first. **When it is exposed**, the GM can foretell that the life of the group will be a bit more complicated because a certain situation that comes from a result of the complication.

The goal with this should add emphasis to the fact that every action as a reaction on the world, even if it isn't in the immediate present.

# What are Extras | Extras

The content of the previous chapter contained every core rules to play Charge. With this, you are fully equipped to have a really fun time playing either just a quick one shot or a full-fledged year spanning campaign.

Now, this next chapter is about **Extras**.

Extras are additional mechanics that you can add in your games to mimic certain types of gameplay or to tailor the game more to your liking.

> ### Charge Contributions
>
> Have you designed an extra for Charge?
>
> Do you think the rest of the community would benefit from it?
>
> If so, post a new topic on [Charge's Itch.io ](https://itch.io/category/1498399/new-topic), and there's a high chance your extra will end up in the official SRD!

# Asset Extra | Extras

## Loot Assets

> For games that are about survival or want to resemble the "Looter and Shooter" genre.

The Loot Asset is an additional mechanic that gives you the chance to find good loot that will have a mechanical impact on the game when you scavenge a place.

After a conflict between multiple parties is resolved or when the general tension in a scene is reduced, you can do a `Fortune Roll` with `Survey` to find good loot or to scavenge the place.

- On a `6`, you create `1 Asset`.
- On a `66`, you create `2 Assets`.

Take note of this asset on your character sheet, and use it when the time is right to get a `+1d6` or `increased effect` on an action roll.

If more than one player is scavenging, you can do a group roll using the `Take the Lead` mechanic.

> **Loot Roll**
>
> - Roll **Survey**.
>   - On a 1-5: nothing happens.
>   - On a 6: You create one Asset
>   - On a critical (66): You create two assets.
> - If an asset was created, take note of it on someone's character sheet.

### Using Loot

When you create an asset using the Loot Extra, the asset can be used by anyone in the group, as long as it makes sense in the narrative.

### Boon Asset

> For moments of great role-play

It's always amazing when a player lose themselves in character or have an amazing idea that is just too brilliant to ignore.

To make those moments shine even more, the GM can reward that player with an `Asset`.

This is like the way for the GM to say: this was amazing, here's `+1d6` or `increased effect` for your roll.

# Making a Compelling Campaign | Preparing the Game

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b529142ada0e29c88323c82eec6c3ab.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-landscape-mountains-rock-6328992/)

You've got a GM and players. You relatively comfortable with the basic mechanics, and you are ready to play Charge.

Amazing!

Now comes the important question that is going to affect everyone for the weeks/months to come: **what should the story be about, and how should it be played out ?**

In the next chapter, we will go over how to find a good setting to play in, how to organize the campaign and how to play it out.

Those are merely suggestions and can be taken with a grain of salt.

Whether this is your first rodeo or not, we think those are good starting points to enjoy a good campaign in general.

This exercise should be done as a group, though some steps could be done solely by the GM depending on what kind of game you want to have.

So first, you need to pick a setting.

## Finding a Setting

Charge is a generic game, so it doesn't come with a default world for you to play in. That means that we leave you the pleasure of talking with the rest of your group to find a setting that makes everyone at the table excited.

A good way to start the conversation is by asking the group to talk about their favourite media.
Things like books, video games, movies, TV shows, etc. If they can't think of anything, ask them what they watched/read/played recently.

For every media that is brought up, try to discuss what it was that made it interesting. Was it the setting, the characters, the magic, the politics ?

From there, take a piece of paper and list everything that is discussed. You might start to see a trend, like a specific genre that seems to interest most of the group.

Once people at the table run out of ideas, you can go over the list of all the suggestions and see if everyone can align on a specific existing setting.

## Establish the World

When the group is aligned on which setting they want to play in, it is important to do a quick refresher on what are the facts of this setting.

This is how we `Establish the World`.

To do so, look at what makes this world unique and fire questions around the table and make sure everyone is aligned on the answers.

If there's magic in the world: who can do it, what do you need to do it, what are the limitations, etc.
If you are in space, which galaxy are you in, are most planets terraformed, etc.

Not everything needs to be factualized. Otherwise, you would end up talking about lots of finicky little details for hours. This isn't the goal.

What isn't covered here will be covered later during a game session. The goal is mostly to get a general understanding of what is accessible and possible.

This exercise could prove to be a little bit more work if the group decided to make a brand new setting that isn't something directly taken from an existing media, but can be very rewarding nonetheless.

## Add Trouble to the World

So, we now have all the main ingredients to make a great campaign, but we are missing one crucial thing: the spices.

We need to add some trouble in our world so that the campaign evolves interestingly overtime. Whether the player characters interact with those events is another subject, but what we want to do is make the world feel real.

This can be done as a group, but could also be done by the GM alone.

It really depends on what type of game you want to play. Do you want everything about the story to be transparent to everyone, or do you prefer that the GM think of these things on their side and keep some surprises for the group.

Your table, your call.

So, to make the world feel real, we define 1-3 `World Forces`.

> A `Force` is something or someone with goals looking to change the status quo in a significant and narratively interesting ways.

We are using the term `Force` here instead of enemy, foe or big bad because a force isn't necessarily a person.

That's why you shouldn't always think of a force as something that will go toe to toe against the PCs.

It is entirely up to the PCs how they want to interact with the World Forces. The group could be opposed to some, allied with others and neutral about the rest.

> A `Force` could be a Person, but it could also be an Organization, a Country, a Planet, Mother Nature or the Space-Time Continuum!

Once you have found one or two interesting **World Forces** in the world, you need to think about their **Goal**.

Their goal defines the impact the force is going to have on the world. A goal isn't necessarily good or bad, it is merely what the force wants to accomplish. It can also be considered as "good" by the Force itself, but others might have different view on the subject.

> A `Goal` could be to take back the throne, protect the galaxy from thieves and thugs, or to open a portal that connects to another world.

Now that we have a **Force,** and that force has a **Goal**, let's find out how they interact with the world to achieve said goal. We do this by defining their **Methods**.

A Force's Methods represents what they do to get closer to their goal. Each Force has around **2-3 Methods**.

> `Methods` could be things like trying to recruit people in an army, trying to corrupt government officials, or increasing the military surveillance over a certain artifact.

You can repeat this exercise as many times as you want depending on how many starting forces you want to have in your world.

Each `Force` will then live inside your world, and as the players interact with the world, the forces do too.

As time advances, they will act with their `Methods`, which will get them closer or farther away from their `Goals`.

> #### Force Example
>
> **The Rebel Forces** want to **get rid of the usurper that sits on the throne by:**
>
> - _Finding dirt on the government to expose corruption._
> - _Convincing the real king to take back what is theirs._
> - _Finding money to hire mercenaries to fight an eventual war._

## Define the Group as a Force

Now that we've added more life into our world, we can determine what the group is all about.

Doing this is going to be pretty straightforward. Simply do the exact same exercise we did above, but now the Force we are creating represents the group of player characters.

To define the group as a **Force**, all the players need to align on what they are about. To do this, they should look back at the `World Forces` and decide how they feel about them. Are they aligned, neutral or against the Goals of those Forces.

That's why we defined the `World Forces` before the `Player Force`.

Once the players have a general idea of what their group is about, write a `Force`, a `Goal` and 2-3 `Methods` that represents them.

## Character Creation

> ### Aspects
>
> Choose `5 Aspects` to define who your character is.
>
> - `Core Concept`: The elevator pitch of your character.
> - `Trouble`: Something or someone that makes your character's life complicated.
> - `Relationship`: Connection with another player's character.
> - `2 Other Aspects`: Anything else you want.
>
> ### Actions
>
> Distribute `7 Action Dots` among the `12 Actions` to define how good your character is at doing things.
>
> - Actions are grouped into 3 attributes: `Physique`, `Insight` and `Resolve`.
> - At character creation, a single `Action` cannot have more than `2 Action Dot`.
>
> #### Physique
>
> - When you `Brawl`, you clash with something that is in your way.
> - When you `Finesse`, you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
> - When you `Move`, you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
> - When you `Sneak`, you traverse skilfully and quietly.
>
> #### Insight
>
> - When you `Shoot`, you carefully track and shoot a target.
> - When you `Tinker`, you understand, create, repair complex mechanisms or organisms.
> - When you `Study`, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
> - When you `Notice`, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.
>
> #### Resolve
>
> - When you `Bond`, you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.
> - When you `Command`, you compel swift obedience with skills, respect or intimidation.
> - When you `Focus`, you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
> - When you `Sway`, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.
>
> ### Momentum
>
> Momentum is gained when your character makes an action roll or accepts a compel. It and can be spent to boost your actions or resist consequences.
>
> You start every session with `2 Momentum`.
>
> - Every time you make an Action Roll, you have a chance to gain `Momentum`.
>
> ---
>
> _Note: When you spend momentum to boost an action roll, you don't gain momentum for that action._
>
> ---
>
> #### Momentum Dial
>
> - For grounded and grittier campaigns:
>   - Gain `+1 Momentum` if you got a `4` or higher.
> - For classic campaigns:
>   - Gain `+1 Momentum` for a `4-5`.
>   - Gain `+2 Momentum` for a `6`.
>   - Gain `+3 Momentum` for a `66`.
>
> #### Using Momentum
>
> | Cost          | Result                                             |
> | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
> | `-2 Momentum` | `Push yourself` and `+1d6` to your action roll.    |
> | `-2 Momentum` | `Take the lead` on a group action.                 |
> | `-1 Momentum` | `Assist` an ally, add `+1d6` to their action roll. |
> | `-1 Momentum` | To do a `Flashback` scene.                         |
>
> ### Talents
>
> Talents make your character stronger and more versatile over time.
>
> - Get `+1 Talent Dot` every `Major Milestone`.
>
> #### Talent Types
>
> A Talent either gives:
>
> - `+1 Action Dot` to spend on a Action
> - A new `Situational Talents`. A Bonus that applies for an `Action` in a certain `Situation` (fill up the blank \_\_\_\_).
>
> ### Stress
>
> On a failed action roll, GM can inflict `Stress` on a PC's `Physical`, `Insight` or `Resolve` condition.
>
> The number of stress inflicted depends on the action's `Position`:
>
> - `Controlled`: `+1 Stress`
> - `Risky`: `+2 Stress`
> - `Desperate`: `+3 Stress`
>
> When you mark `Stress`, you need to write an `Aspect` that represents the PC's current `Condition`.
>
> When a PC's condition has stress, it has an effect on that PC's ability to interact with the world narratively.
> 
> Upon reaching 4 stress, you clear your stress track, and your character is taken out for the scene for they need immediate attention.

<!--
 | Stress Quantity | Effect                                                                                                                                                             |
 | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
 | `1-2 Stress`    | Reduced `Effect` on all action rolls affected by the `Condition`                                                                                                   |
 | `3 Stress`      | Reduced `-1d6` on all action rolls affected by the `Condition`                                                                                                     |
 | `4 Stress`      | The PC is taken out for the scene. At the end of the scene, clear all stress and rename one of the character's 5 Aspects to represent the effect it had on the PC. |
-->

> ### Projects and Complications
>
> Use those Clocks when a player has a long term projects or when the GM inflicts a complications as a `Consequence`.

## Doing Things

> ### Action Roll
>
> Use this when someone, or something, is in your way.
>
> 1. Pick an `Action` and find how many dice you need to roll.
> 1. Determine the Position (`controlled`, `risky`, or `desperate`)
> 1. Determine the Effect Rating (`great`, `standard` or `limited`)
> 1. Choose one:
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `push yourself` (`-2 Momentum`)
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `add tension` to the action.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `-1 Momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
> ---
>
> _If you don't have any action dots and can't `push yourself`, `add tension` or `request assistance`, roll `2d6` and take the worst result._
>
> ---
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                                                       |
> | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You greatly overcome the obstacle.                                |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You overcome the obstacle.                                        |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.           |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You fail at overcoming the obstacle, and there's a `consequence`. |
>
> ### Resistance Roll
>
> Use this to resist a consequence, or incoming `Stress`.
>
> - Roll `1d6` for each dot in the first column of an attribute:
>   - `Physique`: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
>   - `Insight`: Consequences from deception or understanding.
>   - `Resolve`: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                |
> | ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You gain `+1 Momentum`.    |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You consume `-1 Momentum`. |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You consume `-2 Momentum`. |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You consume `-3 Momentum`. |
>
> If you can't consume all the required `Momentum`, the GM inflicts `2 Consequences` instead of one which cannot be resisted.
>
> ### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, reduce all stress tracks by one level.

## Team Work

> ### Take the Lead
>
> Use this to carry the group with your leadership and skills.
>
> - Leader describes how they take the lead and consume `-1 Momentum`
> - Everyone makes an `Action Roll`, the best result counts as the group's result
> - The leader consumes `-1 Momentum` for each player that got a `1-3` as their best result.
> - The leader doesn't get Momentum from the result of that action.
>
> ### Assist
>
> Use this to help a fellow PC in accomplishing their action.
>
> - Consume `-1 momentum` and add `+1d6` to their roll.
> - This also exposes the helper to any potential consequences as a result of the roll.
>
> ### Protect
>
> Use this to to protect a fellow PC from danger.
>
> - Roll to resist someone else's consequence.

## Misc

> ### Progression
>
> Use this to make characters evolve and get stronger over time.
>
> #### Minor Milestone
>
> - Happens every session
> - You can rename one `Aspect`
>
> #### Minor Milestone
>
> - Happens every 3-5 sessions, usually after a big event.
> - Gain `+1 Talent Dot`
>
> ### Consequences
>
> Use this to when there's a `bad outcome` on a PC's Action Roll.
>
> Either:
>
> - The `effect` of the roll is reduced.
> - A narrative `complication` occurs (you can track this on the character sheet).
> - The opportunity is lost and you got to try a new approach.
> - The `position` worsen.
> - The PC takes `stress`
>   - `+1 stress` for a `controlled` position
>   - `+2 stress` for a `risky` position
>   - `+3 stress` for a `desperate` position
>
> ### Fortune Roll
>
> Use this to find out what happens when the PCs aren't involved.
>
> - Add `1d6` per likeliness level.
> - Roll `2d6` and pick the worst if it's really unlikely.
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                                      |
> | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | Great results, and something exceptional happen. |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | Great results.                                   |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | Mixed results.                                   |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | Bad results.                                     |
>
> ### Clocks
>
> Used to define complex obstacles.
>
> - GM creates a clock to representing long-lasting obstacles.
>   - Divide in 4 segments for a complex obstacle.
>   - Divide in 6 segments for a complicated obstacle.
>   - Divide in 8 segments for a daunting obstacle.
>
> ---
>
> When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can tick segments of a `Progress Clock`:
>
> - Tick 1 segment for a `limited effect`.
> - Tick 2 segment for a `standard effect`.
> - Tick 3 segment for a `great effect`.
>
> When a PC gets a consequence off an action roll, you can tick segments of a `Danger Clock`:
>
> - Tick 3 segment for a `desperate position`.
> - Tick 2 segment for a `risky position`.
> - Tick 1 segment for a `controlled position`.
