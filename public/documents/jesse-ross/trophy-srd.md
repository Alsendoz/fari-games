# Risk Roll

When your character attempts a risky task, say what you hope will happen and ask the GM and the other players what could possibly go wrong. Then gather 6-sided dice.

Take one light-colored die if the task is something your character would be able to do because of one of their Skills.

Take another light die for accepting a Devil's Bargain from another player or the GM. Devil's Bargains are described in the following section.

Add a dark-colored die if you are willing to risk your character's mind or body in order to succeed. You must include this die whenever your character performs a Ritual.

Roll the dice. If your highest die is a:


- `1-3:`  Your character fails, and things get worse. The GM describes how. The GM may also allow your character to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. 
- `4-5:`  Your character succeeds, but there's some kind of complication. The GM describes the complication, then you describe how your character succeeds.               
- `6:`  Your character succeeds. Describe how.                                                                                                                          

If your highest die is a dark die (or if a dark and light die tied for highest), and the dark die is higher than your current Ruin, add 1 to your Ruin. When you do, work with the GM to describe how the forest warps your mind and body.

If you are unhappy with your roll and any dark die in the roll isn't the highest die, you may add a dark die to your dice pool and re-roll them all. You may keep adding a dark die and re-rolling until you're satisfied with your result or until a dark die is the highest die in your roll.


# Devil's Bargains

The GM or any other player can offer you a bonus light die if you accept a Devil's Bargain. Common Devil's Bargains include:

 - Your character causes collateral damage or unintended harm.
 - Your character gets lost or separated from their companions.
 - Your character sacrifices an important item.
 - Your character betrays a companion.
 - Your character attracts unwanted attention.

The Devil's Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die.

The Devil's Bargain is always a free choice. If you don't like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just risk your character's mind or body and take a dark die instead.

Anyone may veto or suggest alterations to a proposed Devil's Bargain, especially if it would also impact their character.


# Help Roll

If a player's dice pool includes one dark die, you may offer help to improve their odds of success (either before or after they roll). If they accept your offer, say how you expose yourself to danger and roll one light die. They may include your light die's result when considering their overall success. But if your light die's result matches any of the dark dice in their roll, your own Ruin increases by 1.

You may only suffer a maximum of 1 Ruin when helping on a roll. This is particularly relevant when a player re-rolls a Risk Roll. The helping player doesn't re-roll their light die. However, you still increase your Ruin by 1 if any re-rolled dice show the same number as your light die (provided you haven't increased Ruin by 1 already).

More than one player may offer to help, in which case each player rolls their own light die. The helped player can incorporate all of the light dice into their own Risk Roll.


# Hunt Roll

When you press ever deeper in pursuit of a specific and immediate goal, say how you are exploring your environment, then gather 6-sided dice.

Take one light-colored die just for exploring the world and asking the GM questions about it.

Take another light die if you have a Skill or piece of equipment that would make your hunt easier.

Roll the dice. If your highest die is a:

- `1:` You lose all your tokens, and encounter something terrible.
- `2-3:` You encounter something terrible.
- `4-5:` Take 1 token, but you encounter something terrible.
- `6:` Take 1 token.

Spend 1 token to find something valuable.

Spend 3 tokens to achieve your goal.


# Combat Roll

When you attempt to defeat a monster of the forest, you may combine efforts with your companions.

First say how you expose yourself to injury or attack, then roll a single light die. The number on the die is called your Weak Point, and represents the risks you're taking to face the monster. If multiple characters are involved, each rolls their own die.

Now gather a dark die for each character involved in the attack. Roll all the dark dice together.

To defeat a monster (or group of monsters), you must roll against the monster's Endurance, which is a number between 2 and 12. The GM may reduce the Endurance if you have relevant Skills or are taking advantage of your equipment, environment, or the monster's Weakness in some way. If the Endurance would go below the number of dark dice being rolled, then no Combat Roll is required. The GM may increase the Endurance if the monster is particularly tough, or if you are at a disadvantage. If the Endurance would go above 12, the monster is too difficult to fight and you must retreat, or find a way to reduce the monster's Endurance.

If the total of the two highest dark dice is equal to or higher than the Endurance, the monster is defeated in the manner you and your fellow players describe.

If any of the dark dice equals your Weak Point, your character's Ruin increases by 1 for each dark die matching the Weak Point.

If the two highest dark dice are less than the monster's Endurance and you wish to continue the attack, add one more dark die and re-roll all the dark dice. You may keep adding a dark die and re-rolling until the total of the two highest dark dice is equal to or higher than the Endurance, or until you give up the fight. Retreating from an incomplete fight may trigger Risk Rolls or other consequences.


# Ruin Roll

Your Ruin shows how much physical and mental harm your character has suffered. It starts at 1.

When your character witnesses or undergoes something disturbing, make a Ruin Roll by rolling one dark die. If you've made a Risk Roll which includes a dark die, and that die is equal to or higher than your highest light die in that roll, your dark die is automatically considered a Ruin Roll.

If you rolled higher than your current Ruin, increase your Ruin by 1 and work with the GM to describe how the forest warps your mind and body.


# Reduction Roll

When your Ruin reaches 5, you may now reduce it by acting in the interests of the forest: destroying treasure, preventing the use of Rituals, or sabotaging the other characters' exit from the forest. You should do these acts in a way that does not draw attention to yourself. The more it looks like an accident or simple bad luck, the better.

Each time you act in the forest's interest, roll one light die.

If you rolled less than your current Ruin, your betrayal goes unnoticed and you decrease your Ruin by 1. If you rolled higher than or equal to your Ruin, you may still choose to reduce your Ruin by 1, but someone will notice your attempted betrayal.

You may continue reducing your Ruin in this way when your Ruin drops below 5, until you have 1 Ruin.


# Losing Your Character

When your Ruin reaches 6, your character is lost. This is an important moment: Everyone focuses on your character's last flashes of lucidity before they run away or turn against their companions.

The GM may allow you to take on a co-GM role, helping describe the terrors of the worldâ€”especially any terrors that directly connect to your now-lost character.
