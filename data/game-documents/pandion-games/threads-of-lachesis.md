# What is Threads of Lachesis?

Threads of Lachesis (TOL) SRD, is a guide to create games with branched random events or prompts that the player organizes into a cohesive sequence via one roll of 10 six-sided dice.

Many designs might call for dice with more or fewer sides or additional dice to create more **Acts** depending on the complexity.

Games created with this system can hyper-focus on the span of a second, an hour, a day or zoom out and view the span of a family’s generational legacy, a civilization, or a galaxy. It can be used to quickly create rich and varied character backstories, or used for world building to generate the major and minor events of a nation or continent.

Although Threads of Lachesis’ focus is on solo games and generators, this system was adapted from a traditional TTRPG mechanic defined in the “Additional Adaptations”.

# A Note on Complexity

I’ll come right out and say it: **To use this system requires writing a lot of prompts.** Like the complex, intertwined, and multivariable nature of fate, destiny, and time itself, Threads of Lachesis can quickly become a very large unruly beast to keep track of. Keep in mind how the number of available options to the player multiplies if **Acts** are added or dice sides are increased. It’s not addition, it’s multiplication.

Threads of Lachesis was designed to have a large number of options to produce a myriad of interesting and unique outcomes though each play session may be short. Depending on the prompts created, a player could churn through ten sessions in an evening and have wildly fun and interesting outcomes that are completely different from each other.

You can find options to reduce the number of total prompts needed for Threads of Lachesis in the **“Reducing Complexity”** Section.

For the standard rules as written, you will need 15 **Locations**, 12-36 **Events** per Location and 45 **Closing** prompts. Or 225-585 total written prompts.

# Themes and Tone

Threads of Lachesis games can create awe at the grand expanse of the life of a civilization, or the frenzied twists of a zany trip to the grocery store or the construction of wondrous and flawed characters. When creating a Threads of Lachesis game, ask how you want your players to interact with the **Events** in each **Act**, what the flow between the **Acts** means, and what emotions can be garnered from those interactions and transitions.

Players have a limited ability to increase or decrease the values of dice to change the outcome of the roll and that change affects all future calculations that involve that die- changes by Lachesis have a rippling effect into the future.

# Definitions

**Fate Die**
The die whose value the player can spend to manipulate the dice values.

**Storyboard**
The collection of all the dice, minus the **Fate Die**. Normally contains three **Acts**.

**An Act**
A set of three dice that defines a specific concept, location, epoch, or scene for which the 6 **Events** generated from the three dice are all related.

**Location**
The generalized term to describe the overarching concept an **Act** is about. Defined by summing all dice in the **Act** and using that number on a Location Table.

**Events**
Prompts on lookup tables that players discover by taking or summing dice values in each **Act**.

**Lachesis**
A Fate from Greek Mythology whose job was to measure the thread of life spun by Clotho. She is the decider of destiny.

# Core Mechanics

## The Dice and Storyboard

![](https://i.imgur.com/a6Hd58um.jpg)

The player begins with 10 six-sided dice and rolls all of them at once. The die that lands furthest away from the others becomes the **Fate Die**, the others are used to create the **Storyboard**.

Take the remaining 9 dice and randomly split them into three **Acts**, each containing three dice. It’s from these that the story and events build.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vk3OW3Om.jpg)

The **Fate Die** is used to manipulate the value of dice in the **Acts**. If the player rolls a 3 on the Fate Die, they have 3 points to spend to increase or decrease the value of dice as they see fit.

Each **Act** represents a major concept for the theme you’ve defined. And each **Event** is a subsection exploring that concept.

> So much happens in a single moment. To explore the random events taking place around the world, a single second can be broken into three different locations (each Act), and the Events in each Act look at what happen simultaneously within that moment at each location. Or Acts can be geological eras and the Events explore the rise and fall of animals, plants or movements of whole continents.

# Reading the Storyboard

An **Act** is formed by three dice. Each **Act** has a **Location** or concept the player defines by summing the values of the three dice. Further dice values are then taken or summed to direct players to **Events** that relate to the **Location** for the remaining six numbers.

Dice are read one **Act** at time. Each **Act** generates 7 numbers, which are used on lookup tables. I use the word Location below, but it can be anything you can imagine: It can describe a moment, a space, an epoch, street intersections or the central context of your game. The values are calculated, in order, as follows:

- Sum all the dice = Location #.
- Die 1 = Event 1
- Die 2 = Event 2
- Die 3 = Event 3
- Sum of Dice 1+2 = Event 4
- Sum of Dice 2+3 = Event 5
- Sum of Dice 1+3 = Event 6

![](https://i.imgur.com/N1pZpKpm.jpg)

Players go through each step, look up the value on the appropriate table, read and answer any prompts, then go to the next **Event**. At any time, they are allowed to use their Fate Die to manipulate a die in the **Act**, especially if they don’t like the table’s prompt. _Lachesis intervenes._ Changing the dice values does not change any previously calculated numbers, only the numbers going forward.

After the last **Act** is complete, the player sums all dice in the **Storyboard** and looks up the **Closing** prompt with that number to wrap up the game.

## Considerations

### Repeated Numbers - Tiers or Redirection for Events

With three 6 sided dice per **Act**, the likelihood of rolling or summing duplicate numbers is high. It is recommended to have two to three tiers of each **Event**, with the player reading them in order as duplicates arise.

Or, to keep the number of **Events** to a minimum, direct them to a different **Event** for their second or third duplicate number. How you choose to handle this is up to you. What your game is about will likely dictate the best way to deal with repeated numbers.

### Number of Tables and Prompts

For a standard game created with Threads of Lachesis, you will need 15 **Locations**. There will be a minimum of 12 and maximum of 36 **Events** per Location depending on how you account for repeated numbers. Finally, you’ll have 45 **Closing** prompts.

The standard design gives a range of 225 to 585 total written prompts. Is that a lot? _Yes._

# Reducing Complexity

To decrease the number of prompts:

- Consider droping the summing of dice in each Act
- Use a d4 or d3 instead of a d6
- Omit Closing prompts in favor of a special final-die table. The player simply takes the final Act 3 dice number and uses it on the special Ending table
- Reduce the number of dice in each Act

## Examples of Reducing Complexity:

- If we drop the summing of dice and omit the Closing table in favor of the final-dice Ending Table, the number of needed prompts drops to 15 Locations, 6 Events per location + 6 Endings = 96 prompts.
  - Add 2 additional Event tiers for duplicate numbers and you get 276 prompts to write.
- Using a d4 instead of d6: 9 Locations, 8 Events per Location + 27 Endings = 99 prompts
  - Add 2 additional Event tiers for duplicate numbers and you get 243 prompts

# Additional Adaptations

Threads of Lachesis’s storyboard-like design was originally created as a tool in one of our upcoming traditional tabletop roleplaying games - _Opprobrium_ - to facilitate montage scenes: a chase scene, hunting for clues, a trek across the country. I would be remiss if I did not add our original design here for use in your games.

If you adapt or tweak Threads of Lachesis for a different usage or style of play, please let us know and we will add it to this section with credit to you.

## MONTAGES

Montages are special events that act as cinematic scenes by having the players roll 10 total dice to create a storyboard of action. These are designed to be used during intense, action-heavy moments, complications, or provide more cinematic investigation scenes.

Work with the players to define the potential outcomes at the beginning.

If the characters are trying to find a witness trapped in the burning building, a final successful outcome is a rescue of the witness and the failure outcome is the building burning down around them.

If the players only have failures, the witness could die or become hospitalized and the characters themselves may be seriously injured in the effort.

### Create The Storyboard

- Split 10 dice among all participating players.
- The players performing most of the action or taking lead should receive a greater number of dice, but all players involved should be rolling at least 1 die.
- Players select a Skill they will use for this Montage - They must explain how the skill is relevant to the task.
- The Players roll the dice.
- After the roll, players can distribute their Skill’s Ability number as points to increase the value of any rolled dice.
- Line up each player’s dice in front of the Narrator. This is the storyboard for the Montage.

### Narrate the Dramatic Parts of the Attempt

The Narrator interprets the storyboard in front of them and describes each character’s shortcomings (1’s or 2’s) and wonderful successes (5’s or 6’s) trying to accomplish the task.

The Narrator can also point to Players and have them describe the success or failures of their character in the moment.

**Tip:** Pair off Success and Failures. Narrate the events as one step forward, one step back. The goal of a Montage is to keep the tension high until the final outcome is reached.

### The Final Outcome

The final outcome of the Montage is determined by the total number of Successes vs. Failed dice. 5s and 6s are successes, all others are failures. The more successes, the more positive the outcome, and vice versa.

### Convert Montages to D20 Systems

It is possible to convert this to a d20 system. Define what a successful and failed dice roll is: 15+? 10+? Depending on the system being used, have players use either their Ability Points, Ability Modifiers, or Skill Points. Generally, you want them to be able to manipulate at least one die from a neutral position to success, or a failure to neutral for sake of the narration.
