## The Game

In this game, you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional character you create. Those characters face obstacles and challenges, and you get to decide how they react. The world then changes based on what the characters do.

### What You Need To Play

To play, you will need:

- A set of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- A pile of index cards
- A bunch of awesome people to play with. Usually 2 to 5 people should do the trick. More than that could prove to be difficult.

### Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or *NPC*s.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or *PC*s.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful and captivating.

### Game Structure

Each session is made of `scenes`, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what they do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of certain dice rolls.

During sessions, tension rises during scenes, and the players encounter narrative unknowns. To decide what happens during those moments, the group rolls dice because they want to be on the edge of their seats. They want to be surprised by where the story takes them next.

## Character Creation

Characters are defined by descriptive traits called `details`. Each character usually have between 2-5 details to highlight who they are, and what is important about them.

### Details


> #### Designer Choice: Choose or Adapt
>
> When creating a new character, define their:
> 
> - `Concept`: elevator-pitch of the character.
> - `Appearance`: what the character looks like.
> - `Ties`: relations that the character has with certain people or organizations.

### Actions

To decide how good characters are at doing things, we have the `actions`.

> #### Designer Choice: Choose or Adapt
>
> At character creation, players assign `7 action dots` among the following action list:
>
> - `Muscle`: you use your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
> - `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
> - `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
> - `Sneak`: you traverse skillfully and quietly.
> - `Shoot`: you carefully track and shoot at a target.
> - `Tinker`: you understand, create, or repair complex mechanisms or organisms.
> - `Study`: you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
> - `Notice`: you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.
> - `Bond`: you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.
> - `Command`: you compel swift obedience with skills and respect.
> - `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
> - `Sway`: you influence with guile, charm, or argument.
>
> ---
>
> At character creation, players assign `4 action dots` among the following action list:
>
> - `Muscle`: you your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
> - `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
> - `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
> - `Think`: you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
> - `Talk`: you reassure, socialize or influence with kindness, guile, charm or argument.
> - `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
>
> ---
>
> At character creation, players assign `3 action dots` among the following attributes:
>
> - `Strength` / `Agility` / `Intelligence` / `Charm`
>
> ---
>
> At character creation, players assign `2 action dots` among the following attributes:
>
> - `Power` / `Speed` / `Focus`
>
> ---
>
> _...etc_

At the start of a campaign, a single action cannot have more than 2 action dots.

## Rolling Dice

The game uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it's a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it's a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that's a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it's a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You probably don't achieve your goal, and you suffer complications, too.

Most of the game's mechanics revolve around this basic format.

## Action Rolls

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, and there's a risk of failure, a player makes an `action roll`.

The number of dice to roll depends on the `action` the character is doing. The list of possible action can be found on the character sheet.

The action roll resolves what the PC is doing, as well as the NPC.

Here's what happens when a player makes an action roll:

- The player states their goal and which `action` they are using.
- The GM sets the position of the situation (`controlled`, `risky` or `desperate`)
- The GM sets the effect rating of the action (`limited`, `standard` or `great`)
- The player decide if they boost their roll (if a team member `assists` them, if they `push themselves` or if they `add tension` to the scene)
- Roll the dice and judge the result.
- If the result of the dice is higher than `3`, the PC gains `momentum`

## Momentum

When a player gets a successful action roll, that roll generates `momentum`.

You start every session with `2`, and generate more `momentum` when making action rolls.

- On a `4-5`, you gain `+1 momentum`.
- On a `6`, you gain `+2 momentum`.
- On a `66`, you gain `+3 momentum`.

PCs consume momentum to boost their action rolls. They also use it to resist consequences happening to them, and their teammates.

> #### Designer Note
> 
> For you game, don't hesitate to change when `Momentum` is gained and how much is generated when it's gained. 
> 
> Changing this will affect the whole theme of your game making it feel either grimmer or bigger than life.

## Boosting Action Rolls

If you want, you can add bonus dice to your action roll by using **one** of the following methods.

### Push Yourself

When you `push yourself`, you consume `-2 momentum` **per push** to gain one of the following bonuses.

- Add `+1d6` to your dice pool.
- Gain `+1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action even if you were taken out.

_Note: if you `push yourself` in a action roll, that roll won't generate `momentum`_

### Add Tension

When you `add tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension would look like here?"_. The GM then offers a complication, like ticking segments on a danger clock, inflicting stress on your character, or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the deal, add `+1d6` to your dice pool.

## Team work

The PCs can help one another in different ways to assure that the teams overcome the different challenges that are facing them.

### Assist

When you `assist` a PC, you consume `-1 momentum`, to give `+1d6` to the dice pool of your team mate. When doing this, you also expose yourself to possible danger.

You can also even the odds by using **either** of the following methods.

### Protect

You step in to confront a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene, and suffer the consequence instead of them. You can make a `determination roll` to try to reduce or cancel the consequence.

### Set up

When you perform a setup action, you make an `action roll` to have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets `+1 effect` level or `improved position` for their roll.

You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

## Consequences

If you make an action roll and you get a `partial success (4-5)` or a `bad outcome (1-3)`, you suffer a `consequence`.

The GM chooses one of the following:

- **Reduced Effect** : reduce the `effect` of the action by one level.
- **Complication**: tick one segment per `consequence rating` on a new or existing `danger clock`.
- **Worse Position** : reduce the `position` of the PC by one level for their next action rolls.
- **Lost Opportunity** : what you tried didn't work, you need to use another `action`.
- **Worse Condition**: take `1 stress` per `consequence rating`.

The `consequence rating` is determined by looking at the position for the roll.

- A `controlled` position, generates a consequence rating of `1`.
- A `risky` position, generates a consequence rating of `2`.
- A `desperate` position, generates a consequence rating of `3`.

## Determination Roll

If a character suffers a consequence that you, as a player, don't like, you can try to resist it.

You do so by calling for a `determination roll` to see how well you resist the consequence. You make that roll by burning momentum.

Build a pool of d6s by adding `+1d6` per charge of momentum.

Once you've decided how many charges you want to consume, roll and interpret the results:

- On a `1-3`, The `consequence` still happens.
- On a `4-5`, The `consequence` is reduced.
- On a `6`, The `consequence` is avoided.
- On a `66`, The `consequence` is avoided, and you get +1 position for your next roll.

## Clocks

Clocks are circles divided in either 4, 6 or 8 segments.

Use those to track a task's **progress** or escalating **danger** in scenes.

When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can tick segments of a `progress clock`:

- Tick 1 segment for a `limited effect`.
- Tick 2 segments for a `standard effect`.
- Tick 3 segments for a `great effect`.

When a PC gets a consequence from an action roll, you can tick segments of a `danger clock`:

- Tick 3 segments for a `desperate position`.
- Tick 2 segments for a `risky position`.
- Tick 1 segment for a `controlled position`.

## Health and Condition

When a PC gets hurt as a result of a consequence, they take `stress`. Each stress ticks a segment on the PC's `condition clock ⨁`.

As the condition clock gets filled, you also need to update the PC's `condition` by writing a small descriptive text below the clock.

The character's condition imposes narrative restrictions as to what the character can or cannot do.

When the 4 segments of the `condition clock` are filled, the PC is taken out for the scene and their condition clock is cleared. Because they were taken out, the next scenes should handle how the character's recovery is going to happen in the fiction.

## Recovery

As time passes, PCs will get better, and their condition will improve.

If the fiction allows it, once per session clear 1 segment off a PC's condition clock. Also update the condition text to represent the character's current condition.

## Progression

As a campaign evolves over time, so will the characters.
So at the end of every session, you can update a character's `details` to represent how they grow over the course of the campaign.

When a big event is concluded in the story, the GM can decide to award the group a new `talent dot`.

Players invest those talent dots to make their characters stronger and more versatile.

A talent either gives the PC a new `action dot`, or a `situational talent` that gives a bonus or certain narrative liberty during a specific situation:

- `+1d6 when ______` 
- `+1 position when ______` 
- `+1 effect when ______` 
- `Use [action] instead of [action] when ______` 
- `[narrative liberties] when ______` 

## Fortune Rolls

When the outcome of a situation isn't certain, and the players aren't involved, make a `fortune roll` to see what happens.

Add `+1d6` per likeliness level of that thing hapenning

- On a **critical success**, great results, and something exceptional happens.
- On a **full success**, great results.
- On a **partial success**, mixed results.
- On a **bad outcome**, bad results.

## Flashbacks

Players can call for a `flashback` scene if they want to declare that their character tried to prepare for a certain situation before it happened. Flashback scenes aren't like timetravel, and can't undo what was already been established.

When a player calls for a flashback scene:

- The GM sets a cost in `momentum` between `0-2` for the scene.
- Depending on the fiction, either
  - the player gets what they want.
  - the GM makes a fortune roll to see what happens.
  - the player makes an action roll to see what happens.
