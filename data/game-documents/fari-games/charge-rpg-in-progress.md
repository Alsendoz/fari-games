<!--## Momentum from Adding Tension

The second way you can gain momentum is by `adding tension` to the scene.

As a player, you can suggest a complication to your GM, and if they agree with it you gain `+2 momentum`.

When you add tension to a scene, you usually inflict a `consequence` on yourself or the group to add interesting drama to the scene.-->

> Use this to try to change a situation for the better and set someone up for success.

> Assets let you improve an subsequent Action Roll by either: `+1d6`, `+Effect` or `+Position`
>
> 1. Pick an `Action` and find how many dice you need to roll
> 1. Determine the Position (`controlled`, `risky`, or `desperate`)
> 1. Determine the Effect Rating (`great`, `standard` or `limited`)
> 1. Choose one:
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `push yourself` (`-2 Momentum`)
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `use an Asset`
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `-1 Momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!

> _Gain `+2 Momentum` for a `critical success`. Otherwise, gain `+1 Momentum`._
